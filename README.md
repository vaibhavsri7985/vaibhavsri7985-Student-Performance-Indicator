# Student Performance Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes student performance based on various factors such as academic background, extracurricular activities, and personal details. The goal is to identify key predictors of student success and build a model to predict performance levels.  

## Dataset Information  
The dataset contains various attributes, including:  
- **Demographic details** (e.g., gender, parental education)  
- **Academic background** (e.g., previous grades, attendance)  
- **Lifestyle factors** (e.g., study hours, extracurricular activities)  

## Steps Followed  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   
- Visualized distributions and relationships between features.  
- Examined correlations between variables affecting student performance.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- **Encoding** categorical variables (e.g., parental education, gender).    
- **Handling multicollinearity** by removing redundant features.  

### 3. Model Building & Evaluation  
- Built multiple models: **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost**.  
- Applied **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.  
- Selected the best-performing model for final predictions.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** for machine learning  

## Conclusion  
- Successfully analyzed key factors influencing student performance.  
- Identified the most important features contributing to academic success.  
- Developed a predictive model to help educators and institutions improve student outcomes.
